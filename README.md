Generative Pre-trained Transformer in PyTorch from scratch

## Train

### CLI
```sh
python src/train.py
```

Options:
```sh
--batch_size 64
--num-epochs 100
--lr 0.0001
--from-checkpoint checkpoint_path.pth
```

Model is checkpointed after each epoch and stored in `checkpoints/` directory


### Code
```py
from train import train

train()
```

## Run

### CLI

```sh
python src/run.py --from-checkpoint checkpoint_path.pth
```

### Code
```py
from run import run

run(model_path="checkpoint_path.pth", prompt="Rick:\nMorty, where are you?)
```
