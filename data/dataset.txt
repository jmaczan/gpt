### Dialogue Continuation
User: What are Newton's Laws of Motion?
Assistant: Newton's Laws of Motion include:
1. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma).
3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

User: Can you explain recursion?
Assistant: Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on smaller instances of the same problem. A common example is the factorial function.

### American Literature
American Literary Nationalism: A literary movement in the United States during the early to mid-19th century, where authors aimed to develop a distinct American literature emphasizing spiritual values and social usefulness.
Great American Novel: A term coined by John William De Forest in 1868, referring to a canonical novel that embodies and examines the essence and character of the United States.
American Poetry: Poetry that originated in the United States, beginning with efforts by American colonists in the 17th century to add their voices to English poetry, and evolving into a distinct American idiom by the 19th century.
American Literary Regionalism: Also known as "local color," this style or genre of writing in the United States gained popularity in the mid-to-late 19th century and early 20th century, emphasizing specific features of particular regions, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape.
American Gothic Fiction: A subgenre of Gothic fiction specific to American literature, characterized by themes such as rationality versus the irrational, puritanism, guilt, the uncanny, ghosts, and monsters.
Southern United States Literature: Literature written about the Southern United States or by writers from the region, beginning during the colonial era and developing significantly during and after the period of slavery in the United States.
American Dream in Literature: A recurring theme in American literature, representing ideals such as equality, opportunity, and the belief that hard work leads to success, as explored in works like F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" and John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
American Literature (Academic Discipline): An academic field devoted to the study of literature written or produced in the United States and its preceding colonies, encompassing various genres, periods, and movements.
American Literature (Journal): A scholarly journal established in 1929, focusing on the study and analysis of American literature across different periods and genres.
American Literary Awards: Various honors and prizes established to recognize outstanding contributions to American literature, celebrating achievements in fiction, poetry, drama, and other literary forms.

### Theoretical physics
Quantum Entanglement: A phenomenon where two or more particles become interconnected, such that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.
Wave-Particle Duality: The concept that particles, such as electrons and photons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are measured.
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: A fundamental limit in quantum mechanics stating that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle.
Quantum Superposition: The principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured.
Schrödinger's Equation: A mathematical equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.
Pauli Exclusion Principle: A quantum mechanics rule stating that no two fermions (such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state within a given system.
Planck's Constant: A fundamental physical constant that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency, playing a crucial role in quantum mechanics.
Black Hole Event Horizon: A boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape due to extreme gravitational pull.
Hawking Radiation: Theoretical radiation predicted by Stephen Hawking, emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon.
General Relativity: Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, describing how mass and energy warp spacetime, affecting the motion of objects.
